    <h1>African culture</h1>
    <img class="img-culture" src="img/culture1.jpg" alt="culture1">
    <p class="description-culture">Africa is an amazing continent for many reasons, one of which is considered to be a distinctive and diverse culture that varies from place to place. Therefore, tourism in Africa attracts people from all over the planet who want to learn something new and exciting.
        All sorts of cultures have united on the African continent, since this place is considered the ancestral home of all mankind. In addition, the countries of Africa have long been colonies of great empires and European states that have definitely left their cultural heritage. This explains the amazing symbiosis that exists today.</p>
    <div class="about-culture1">
        <p class="img-culture1"><img src="img/culture2.jpg" alt="culture2"></p>
        <p class="description-culture1">The true culture of Africa is based on family traditions, which are indisputably observed and respected, as well as on the characteristics of numerous ethnic groups. Also, all local art is imbued with their religious beliefs and social characteristics.
            All African art is concentrated around the human figure, while the images are often abstract than real. Studying the cultural news of Africa, you will notice that the artists prefer to work with three-dimensional space (sculpture), rather than two-dimensional. In addition, a feature of African artworks is that they usually have distorted proportions. Africans are striving to destroy the line between art and real life, using certain objects created by masters in everyday life and traditional rituals.
            Looking at goods from Africa *, you will notice that among them there are a large number of masks and figurines, since African plastic has a strong place in the local culture. These items are used in various rituals, rituals to scare away evil spirits or to preserve the soul of the deceased.
            African music has long roots, but the use of various drums and the extraction of unusual sounds is constant. These sounds are usually accompanied by dances, which were previously performed during all kinds of rituals and hunting, so the traditional movements are sharp and accompanied by battle cries.</p>

        <p class="img-about-culture2"><img src="img/culture3.jpg" alt="culture3"></p>
        <p class="description-culture2">Contemporary African culture
            Many tourists come to the black continent just to touch the culture that has been preserved there for centuries. It is her originality and uniqueness that attracts a modern person. Of course, now African music can be supplemented by new musical instruments and arrangements, but it only benefits from this, because ethnic motives are preserved and embellished.
            Even African plasticity was inherited by the Cubists in the last century, thanks to which amazing motifs can be observed in the paintings of European masters. The film industry is still poorly represented in Africa, only Algeria and Egypt can boast of some developments. But all those creations that exist (cinema and literature), their main goal is to create a different, better image of Africa for the whole world.</p>
